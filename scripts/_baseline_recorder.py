"""Record the outcome of every collected test as a machine-readable list.

Loaded by `scripts/check_test_baseline.py` with `-p`, so this file is never imported by the suite
itself and a normal `pytest` run is unaffected by it. It exists because the baseline the suite is
diffed against has to be a *set of node ids* and not a count: the two failures that motivated the
check were a silent pass (an uncollected outcome that reads as green) and a count that can fall
while a new failure appears, and no summary line distinguishes either.

Written to `$RELIC_CORE_BASELINE_OUT` as JSON, a list of `[nodeid, outcome]` sorted by node id, so
two runs of the same tree produce byte-identical files.
