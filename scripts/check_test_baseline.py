"""Diff the suite's outcomes against the recorded baseline, as a set of node ids.

`python -m pytest tests/` has a non-empty baseline: the failures that are known on this host are
recorded in `tests/baseline_failures.txt` by node id, and this script is the thing that keeps that
set honest. No count is quoted here on purpose -- a number that lives in a docstring goes stale the
first time somebody fixes a test, and the file is the authority.

Two failure modes it exists for, both of which a summary line hides:

- **A silent pass.** The deleted `tests/test_cpp_backend_batching.py` branched on `sys.argv` and
  `return`ed when under-specified, so a run with no path argument reported a green line for a test
  that never ran. A node id that is *expected* to fail and now passes is worth as much attention as
  one that broke, so the diff is symmetric.
- **A falling count.** Three passes gained and one failure introduced is a net improvement in the
  count and a regression in the tree. Counting is not diffing.

Usage::

    python scripts/check_test_baseline.py                # run the suite, diff, exit 1 on anything new
    python scripts/check_test_baseline.py --observed FILE # diff an already-recorded run
    python scripts/check_test_baseline.py --update       # rewrite the baseline from a fresh run
