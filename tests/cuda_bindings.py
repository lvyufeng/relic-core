"""Getting the built CUDA extension, with a skip instead of a failure when it cannot be had.

`pytest.importorskip` and `load_cuda_kernel() -> None` guard the *extension loading*. They do not
guard an individual op: a test that loads the extension successfully and then calls a binding that
does not exist gets an `AttributeError`, which pytest reports as a **failure**, not a skip. Four
tests were in exactly that state -- the GQA decode kernels whose sources are on disk and not
compiled, and whose bindings therefore resolve nowhere -- and each of them read as a broken test
rather than as an unbuilt feature.

`extension()` closes that hole: ask for the bindings the test needs and get either the module or a
skip that names the missing ones. A skip here is a statement about the build, not about the test's
correctness, which is the same claim `pytest.importorskip` makes one level up.

`docs/guides/cuda_extension_builds.md` is where the missing-source situation is recorded; pass
`why` when the skip needs to point at it.
