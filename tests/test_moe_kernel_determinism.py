"""Are the FP4 MoE kernels run-to-run reproducible?

Speculative decoding measured a real defect: DSpark always-k produced different
tokens from itself on the same prompt with the same weights (docs/performance/dspark.md,
"Output determinism"). That is distinct from batch-vs-sequential drift, which is
expected -- N-token and 1-token forwards reduce in different orders, so their
logits differ and an argmax near a tie can flip. Nondeterminism is not expected
and is fixable.

Both MoE kernels accumulate a token's top-k routes with atomicAdd, so the
summation order follows block scheduling and float addition is not associative.
This isolates that: same inputs, same weights, twice, bitwise compare. No
checkpoint needed -- random FP4 bytes exercise the same arithmetic.

    takes the scan and this is the one that reaches the new kernel. The bar here is bit-identity
    rather than a tolerance: the CSR lists a row's pairs in ascending pair order, which is the order
    the scan adds them in, so the two are the same float additions in the same sequence. Anything
